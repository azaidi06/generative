* First we'll start off with a something simple [Autoencoder](autoencoder.ipynb)
* We'll then we'll make it even more robust: [Variational Autoencoders](vae.ipynb)
    + A brief foray to better understand the dataset requirements -- [How much data do we need?!](how_much_data.ipynb)
* Can [GANs]() take us to the next level?
